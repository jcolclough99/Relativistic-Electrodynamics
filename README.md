# What this university project achieves and how:
This code models EM fields of charged particles at relativistic velocities. It uses the leapfrog method to create an array of position coordinates and upates the velocity and acceleration vector at at each step. There are two trajectories modelled, one for synchrotron radiation and the other for cherenkov radiation. Based on those trajectories we then use the relativistic formulas to find the fields at certain coordinates. We do this using the retarded positions and times. There are many different functions for generation of the fields depending on which set of points you wish to observe.
